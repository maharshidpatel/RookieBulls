/**
 * MODULE: /server/modules/education
 *
 * Delivers structured learning content to users.
 * This module is POST-MVP — it is scaffolded now but not built yet.
 *
 * Planned responsibilities:
 *  - Store and serve lessons and learning modules
 *  - Track which lessons a user has completed
 *  - Gate certain content behind lesson completion
 *  - Unlock simulation features as users progress through content
 *
 * Why it exists now if it is not built yet:
 *  The folder and files are created now so the structure is consistent
 *  and the module boundary is reserved. When education is built,
 *  it slots into the existing architecture without restructuring anything.
 *
 * Post-MVP scope:
 *  Basic lesson delivery and progress tracking first.
 *  Gating and unlock logic second.
 *  Advanced content types (video, interactive) much later.
